/*When gasoline is $100 per barrel, then the consumerâ€™s price at the pump is between $3.50
and $4.00 per gallon. Create a class named GasPrices . Its main() method holds an integer
variable named pricePerBarrel to which you will assign a value entered by a user at the
keyboard. Create a method to which you pass pricePerBarrel . The method displays the
range of possible prices per gallon. For example, if gas is $120 per barrel, then the price at
the pump should be between $4.20 and $4.80. Save the application as GasPrices.java.*/
